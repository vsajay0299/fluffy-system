Secure Voting Process:

Problems:

Only 67.11% people voted in the 2019 Lok Sabha Elections.
People working and studying in other states cannot cast their vote.
Old people who cannot walk and are sick cannot go to the election centre.
EVM scam.They try to manupilate the votes.
Manual counting can be done wrong.



Solution:

->Either go to the voting centre and vote
    Aadhar has details of every citizen of India. It has their fingerprints and the iris scan who nobody can fake/duplicate.
    When the person enters the centre, fingerprints and iris will be scanned. When scanned, Azure Blockchain systems will eliminate the name
   from the list of voters so that no one else can vote in any other constituency with the same name. When the scanning is successful, IOT sensors
   will get activated and the door to the voting area will be opened.The IOT sensors will make sure only one person enters the room or else an alarm
   will ring which everyone can hear and the person can be held and put into jail. 
   This will ensure nobody else can enter the voting area.
   When casting the vote, you can press only one button,the button next to the party you want to vote for.
   The EVM consists of Azure Blockchain Tech software which instantly sends the response of the voter to a database handled by ECI(Only the 
   response of which party will be sent, not the information of the voter at that particular time)
   IOT sensors will sense that there is only one person in the room, and therefore will open the door for the voter to leave.
   The process will be repeated till all the voters don't cast their vote.
                         
                         
                         
                         OR




->Vote Online through the App.
     The app will be secured and handled by Azure Blockchain Tech software.
     It will take the name of the citizen on the Aadhar Card,Aadhar number,will send an OTP to the Aadhar registered number and if the citizen is
     18yrs and above ,the software will direct the page to a EVM type party emblem list from which he/she can choose and vote. 
     After choosing the party, the app will automatically go to the homepage, exiting the Aadhar you entered.
     [If the person is not on the electoral list, he/she can register through the app as the software will know whether the citizen is 18yrs and above
     through the Aadhar Card]
     This method will ensure that people working or studying in other states and the old people who are sick and cannot walk
     can cast their vote and complete their duty and responsibility to vote.
As the voting Data goes to the ECI instantly on voting through the Azure Blockchain Tech software securely(this avoids any EVM scams)
, the ECI can declare the votes instantly after the polls close.

ELECTION FINISHED
